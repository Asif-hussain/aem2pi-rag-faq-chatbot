Company HR & Product FAQ


Welcome to the company internal FAQ. This document covers key policies, procedures, and feature explanations relevant to employees and support staff. The goal is to provide a one-stop place for answers about leaves, payroll, remote work, account management, product features, security practices, and escalation paths.


1. Leave and Attendance Policy
Our leave policy aims to offer flexibility while ensuring fairness and operational continuity. Employees are entitled to 20 paid annual leave days per year. Requests should be submitted through the HR portal at least 7 days in advance for planned leaves. Emergency leaves can be reported by email to HR and logged in the portal within 48 hours. Leave balances are displayed on each employee's dashboard and updated after payroll runs.


Carry forward rules permit up to 5 unused leave days to be carried into the next fiscal year, but they must be used within the first quarter. Managers may approve additional carry-forward on a case-by-case basis.


2. Work-from-Home and Remote Work
The company supports flexible work arrangements. Employees may work remotely up to three days per week, subject to manager approval. Remote work requires that employees maintain secure home networks and comply with the company's security guidelines. Remote days should be recorded in the team calendar to assist coordination. Full-time remote work or relocation requires HR and legal sign-off for tax and benefits implications.


3. Account Management and Passwords
All employees must use the company Single Sign-On (SSO) to access internal applications. Passwords must be at least 12 characters with a mix of upper/lowercase, digits, and symbols. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all admin accounts and recommended for all employees. If an employee forgets their password, they can use the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page, which triggers an email with a secure one-time link valid for 30 minutes. For account lockouts or suspicious activity, employees should contact IT Security immediately.


4. Payroll and Benefits
Payroll runs on the last working day of each month. Salary breakdowns, tax withholdings, and benefits deductions are available in the payroll section of the HR portal. For discrepancies, employees must raise a ticket within 10 business days of the payroll date. Health insurance coverage begins the first day of employment for full-time employees following successful completion of onboarding.


5. Product Features and Support
The product provides role-based access control, a dashboard with KPI visualizations, and report export functionality in CSV and PDF formats. Admins can invite users, configure roles, and manage billing through the admin console. The support team handles tier-1 issues; tier-2 escalations involve engineering for bug fixes or configuration changes.


6. Security and Data Privacy
We follow industry-standard security practices, including regular patching, encrypted data storage, and periodic penetration testing. Sensitive PII data collection is minimized; where PII must be collected, it's encrypted at rest and access-controlled. Data retention policies specify that logs are kept for 1 year and archived for up to 7 years as needed for compliance.


7. Onboarding & Offboarding
Onboarding includes account setup, an equipment checklist, and mandatory training modules on security and code of conduct. Offboarding must follow the standard checklist: revoke access, collect equipment, and conduct an exit interview. Termination cases require HR and Legal approvals and should be processed within 3 business days.


8. Escalation Path & SLAs
Support issues follow an SLA matrix based on severity:
- Sev 1: system down — Response within 1 hour, resolution or mitigation within 8 hours.
- Sev 2: major feature broken — Response within 4 hours, resolution within 48 hours.
- Sev 3: minor bug or question — Response within 2 business days.


9. Feature Release & Versioning
Releases follow a bi-weekly cadence with release notes published in the team wiki. Breaking changes require a deprecation notice 30 days in advance, and migration guides are provided.


10. Common How-tos
- How to invite a new user: Admins -> Users -> Invite -> Fill email and role.
- How to export a report: Dashboard -> Reports -> Select filters -> Export -> Choose CSV or PDF.
- How to reset a password: Account Settings -> Reset Password -> Follow email link.


11. Performance Reviews and Compensation
Performance reviews are conducted annually at the end of each fiscal year. Employees receive a self-assessment form two weeks before their review meeting with their manager. Reviews are based on goal achievement, teamwork, technical skills, and alignment with company values. Managers use a rating scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates underperformance and 5 represents exceptional contribution. All ratings are calibrated in cross-functional review sessions to ensure fairness and consistency across departments.

Compensation adjustments, including salary increases and bonuses, are determined based on performance ratings, market benchmarks, and budget allocations. Salary reviews occur within 30 days of completing the performance cycle. Employees rated 4 or above are eligible for performance bonuses, which range from 5% to 15% of base salary. Promotion decisions are separate from annual reviews and require manager nomination, peer feedback, and approval from the leadership team.


12. Training and Professional Development
The company is committed to continuous learning and professional growth. All employees have access to an annual learning budget of $2,000 for courses, certifications, conferences, or workshops. To use this budget, employees must submit a learning request form through the HR portal, which requires manager approval. Approved expenses are reimbursed within two pay cycles after submission of receipts.

Additionally, the company offers internal training sessions on topics such as cybersecurity awareness, leadership skills, effective communication, and technical tooling. Attendance at mandatory compliance training sessions is tracked and required for all employees. Employees who fail to complete mandatory training within 30 days of onboarding or annual reminders may face account access restrictions until training is completed.


13. Employee Benefits and Perks
Full-time employees receive a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance, dental and vision coverage, life insurance, and a retirement savings plan with a 4% company match. Health insurance enrollment occurs during onboarding or the annual open enrollment period each November. Changes to benefits outside of these windows require a qualifying life event, such as marriage, birth of a child, or loss of other coverage.

The company also provides wellness perks including gym membership reimbursements up to $50 per month, mental health support through an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and quarterly wellness challenges with prizes. Employees can access confidential counseling services via the EAP at no cost for up to six sessions per year.


14. Equipment and IT Support
All new hires receive company-issued equipment, including a laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and headset. Equipment type and specifications depend on the employee's role and are determined during onboarding. Employees working remotely may request additional equipment such as ergonomic chairs or standing desks, subject to manager and IT approval.

IT support is available via the internal helpdesk ticketing system or by emailing support@company.com. Standard issues such as password resets and software installations are resolved within 24 hours. Hardware failures are addressed based on severity, with critical issues receiving same-day support and non-critical issues resolved within 3 business days. Loaner equipment is available for employees experiencing hardware failures to minimize downtime.


15. Code of Conduct and Ethics
All employees are expected to uphold the company's code of conduct, which emphasizes integrity, respect, accountability, and collaboration. Harassment, discrimination, or retaliation of any kind is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Employees who witness or experience misconduct should report it immediately to HR or use the anonymous ethics hotline.

Conflicts of interest must be disclosed to HR and management. This includes financial interests in competitors, secondary employment, or personal relationships that may affect objectivity. The company reviews all disclosures and works with employees to mitigate potential conflicts while maintaining transparency.


16. Data Handling and Compliance
Employees handling customer data or personally identifiable information (PII) must adhere to strict data protection policies. All customer data must be stored in approved systems with encryption at rest and in transit. Access to sensitive data is granted on a need-to-know basis and logged for audit purposes. Unauthorized sharing or downloading of customer data is grounds for immediate termination and may result in legal action.

The company complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other regional data privacy regulations. Employees are required to complete annual data privacy training and acknowledge the data handling policy. Data breaches or suspected security incidents must be reported to the security team within 1 hour of discovery, and the incident response team will investigate and remediate according to the established protocol.


17. Customer Support Tiers and Responsibilities
The support team is organized into three tiers. Tier 1 handles general inquiries, account issues, and basic troubleshooting. Common tier-1 issues include login problems, password resets, and navigation questions. Tier 1 agents are expected to resolve issues within one business day or escalate to tier 2.

Tier 2 support addresses more complex technical issues, such as integration failures, data discrepancies, and configuration errors. Tier 2 agents work closely with product and engineering teams to diagnose and resolve issues. Response times for tier-2 cases depend on severity, with high-priority cases receiving attention within 4 hours.

Tier 3 support involves engineering intervention for bugs, performance issues, or feature requests requiring code changes. Tier 3 cases are tracked in the engineering backlog and prioritized based on customer impact and business value. Customers are provided with regular status updates until resolution.


18. Internal Communication and Collaboration
The company uses a combination of email, Slack, and project management tools for internal communication. Slack is the primary channel for real-time communication, while email is reserved for formal announcements, policy updates, and external correspondence. All employees are expected to check email and Slack daily and respond to urgent messages within 2 hours during business hours.

Weekly team meetings are held to align on priorities, discuss blockers, and share updates. Meeting agendas are shared 24 hours in advance, and notes are documented in the team wiki. Cross-functional collaboration is encouraged, and employees are empowered to reach out directly to colleagues in other departments for support or information.


19. Incident Management and Escalation
When a system incident occurs, the on-call engineer is notified via PagerDuty or the designated alerting system. The on-call engineer assesses the severity and initiates the incident response process. For severity 1 incidents (complete system outage), a war room is established, and stakeholders including engineering, product, and customer success are notified immediately.

Incidents are tracked in the incident management system, and post-mortem reports are required for all severity 1 and severity 2 incidents. Post-mortems focus on root cause analysis, timeline of events, impact assessment, and action items to prevent recurrence. All post-mortems are reviewed in engineering team meetings and shared with leadership.


20. Product Roadmap and Feature Requests
The product roadmap is reviewed quarterly and informed by customer feedback, business goals, and technical priorities. Feature requests can be submitted by employees or customers via the feedback portal. Each request is reviewed by the product team and categorized by priority, feasibility, and alignment with strategic objectives.

High-priority features are added to the product backlog and scheduled for upcoming sprints. Customers who submitted feature requests are notified when their request is under development or released. The product team publishes release notes for every deployment, highlighting new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
